# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Captsone Project
# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction 
This project aims at predicting Customer churn at Telecom Companies using various Machine Learning Techniques. 
This is a supervised learning problem. 
Algorithms explored in this project are 
* Logistic Regression

* XGBOOST

* Artificial Neural Networks 

Please refer to the Project Report file named ProjectReport to read about the choice of metrics used to compare the algorithms, the data set used, 
and detailed documentation of the results obtained and hyperparameters used.
Please do check out the Improvements section in project report and feel free to suggest changes and new techniques for optimization of the model 
and model and hyperparameter tuning



# Install
You must have Python and the following libraries installed to make this project work.

* Numpy

Also consider installing Anaconda on your machine, from which you can open the Jupiter Notebooks and the python files.


# Code

The file Telecom_Churn.ipynb contains the code for this project. This is a Jupiter Notebook.

# Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory boston_housing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb or

jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

If you're using Anaconda, open up Anaconda. You should get a prompt for Jupiter, Spyder and Visual Studio. Select the option for Jupiter and you 
should have a directory open in the browser which contains all files on your computer. Navigate to the directory where you have extracted the project and open the .ipynb file


# Data 

Please refer to the file ProjectReport.pdf for detailed description of the dataset. This includes the columns of the dataset and it's description.
